# Image Understanding
A simple object detection model using RESNET to show the value of ImageUnderstanding.

RetinaNet is a single, unified network composed of a backbone network and two task-specific subnetworks. 
The backbone is responsible for computing a conv feature map over an entire input image and is an off-the-self convolution network. 
The first subnet performs classification on the backbones output.
The second subnet performs convolution bounding box regression.
